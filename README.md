# Environment-Impact-Tracker-
Developed an AI-powered data analysis system using TensorFlow for anomaly detection in environmental data, achieving.


The Environment Impact Tracker project integrates a SQL database with an API built using Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy. It enables the storage and retrieval of environmental metrics such as temperature, humidity, and air quality for various locations. The SQL database stores structured data efficiently, while the API provides endpoints for retrieving real-time environmental data. This project facilitates seamless integration of dynamic data sources, supporting applications that require accurate and timely environmental monitoring and analysis.
